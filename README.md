## Features

 - Pure JavaScript (no jQuery)
 - Python 2 and 3 support
 - Auto swapping based on your environment
 - Pluggable as it returns a simple django file, just like native input
 - Easily extensible (authentication, styles)


## Installation

Just install S3file using `pip` or `easy_install`.
```bash
pip install django-s3file
```
Don't forget to add `s3file` to the `INSTALLED_APPS`.


## Usage

### Simple integrations

Include s3file's URLs in your URL root.

**urls.py**
```python
urlpatterns = patterns(
    ...
    url(r'^s3file/', include('s3file.urls')),
)
```

**forms.py**
```python
from s3file.forms import AutoFileInput

class MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):

    class Meta:
        model = MyModel
        fields = ('my_file_field')
        widgets = {
            'my_file_field': AutoFileInput
        }
```
**Done!** No really, that's all that needs to be done.


### Setting up the CORS policy on your AWS S3 Bucket

```xml
<CORSConfiguration>
    <CORSRule>
        <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
        <AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
        <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
        <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
    </CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```


### Advanced usage examples

#### Authentication
The signing endpoint supports CSRF by default but does not require a authenticated user.
This and other behavior can be easily added by inheriting from the view.

**views.py**
```python
from s3file.views import S3FileView
from braces.views import LoginRequiredMixin

class MyS3FileView(LoginRequiredMixin, S3FileView):
    pass
```

Now don't forget to change the URLs.

**urls.py**
```python
urlpatterns = patterns(
    ...
    url('^s3file/sign',
        MyS3FileView.as_view(), name='s3file-sign'),
)
```
